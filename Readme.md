# Image Styling Website

Welcome to our Image Styling Website! This web application allows you to combine the details of a feature image with the style of another image to create a unique, stylized image.

## How It Works

Our website uses a sophisticated algorithm to extract the details from one image (the feature image) and the style from another image (the style image). It then combines these two to generate a new image that has the details of the feature image and the style of the style image.

## Usage

1. **Upload your images**: On the home page, you'll find an option to upload two images - the feature image and the style image. The feature image is the one whose details you want to preserve, and the style image is the one whose style you want to apply to the feature image.

2. **Style your image**: After uploading the images, click on the "Style your image" button. This will start the process of generating your stylized image.

3. **View your stylized image**: Once the image has been generated, it will be displayed on the website. You can then view or download your stylized image.

## Example

Here's an example of what you can do with our website:

- Feature Image: A photo of a cityscape.
- Style Image: A painting by Van Gogh.
- Stylized Image: The cityscape photo rendered in the style of Van Gogh's painting.

We hope you enjoy using our Image Styling Website!
