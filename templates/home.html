    <h1> My Projects </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold">AI Image Styler</span>: This project uses AI to style an image based on another image. Given a detail image and a style image, it combines the details and styles of both to create a new image. For example, you can turn a photo of yourself into a painting or a sketch. </li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold">AI Blog Generator</span>: This project uses AI to create a blog page given the title of the blog. It generates the content and layout, for the blog based on the topic and the tone that you specify. For example, you can create a blog about your favorite hobby or a travel destination. </li>
      <li> <span style="font-weight:bold">AI Chat Bot</span>: This project uses AI to create a basic chat bot that can converse with you on various topics. It uses natural language processing and generation to understand your messages and respond appropriately. For example, you can chat with it about the weather, sports, or movies. </li>
    </ul>
